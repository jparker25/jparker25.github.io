<p>Welcome to my professional website!</p>
<p>I’m currently a postdoctoral associate at the University of Pittsburgh, where I conduct research in mathematical
    neuroscience with a focus on Parkinson's Disease modeling. I am actively seeking new opportunities in both academia
    and industry and would be happy to discuss how I can contribute to your organization. For a more detailed overview
    of my background, visit the <a href="/about/">About Me</a> section. If you’re interested in my research
    dissemination, check out the <a href="/presentations/">Presentations</a> and <a
        href="/publications/">Publications</a> sections.</p>
<p>Below are some recent updates to my portfolio, with more to come! Please feel free to get in touch.</p>
