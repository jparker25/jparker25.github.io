Welcome to my webpage! Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Pittsburgh working with [Dr. Jonathan Rubin](https://www.mathematics.pitt.edu/people/jonathan-rubin). In this position, I am working with Dr. Rubin on mathematical neuroscience research that focuses on understanding the subtantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) under dopamine depletion. Besides the quick blurbs below, you can check out the tabs up above to learn more about myself and my research. Feel free to reach out and connect!

### Research Interests
As a quick overview, my research interests include dynamical systems, chaos theory, mathematical biology, and computational neuroscience. I especially enjoy building computational models and simulations for different mathematcial models. Since my undergraduate days, a research "throughline" has always been mathematical and computational neuroscience, and this has been the focus of my doctoral and postdoctoral work.

### Doctoral Work
I received my doctorate in Applied Mathematics through the Integrated Applied Mathematics Program at the Unviersity of New Hampshire under the supervision of [Dr. Kevin Short](https://findscholars.unh.edu/display/kmshort). My doctoral work focused on mutual stabilization in chaotic neurons. Mutual stabilization can occur when two chaotic systems interact a certain way such that the individual systems are driven to periodic orbits due to nature of the interaction. Mutual stabilization was previously shown through interacting cupolets (chaotic unstable periodic orbit-lets) formed from two double scroll oscillators. The first major result of my dissertation demonstrated that two FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons, interacting bidirectionally, can exhibit chaotic behavior. This chaotic behavior can be controlled and shown to mutually stabilize when a sigmoidal synaptic learning rule is implemented. This work was published [here](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0002328). The second major result focused on showing the existence of cupolets in a chaotic Hindmarsh-Rose neuron. The properties of these cupolets were then explored and it was demonstrated how mutual stabilization can be achieved through two interacting Hindmarsh-Rose neurons. These results wre published in my dissertation which can be found [here (open-access)](https://unh.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://www-proquest-com.unh.idm.oclc.org/dissertations-theses/existence-mutual-stabilization-chaotic-neural/docview/2559455643/se-2?accountid=14612).
