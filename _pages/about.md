Welcome to my webpage! Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Pittsburgh working with Dr. Jonathan Rubin. In this position, I am working with Dr. Rubin on mathematical neuroscience research that focuses on understanding the subtantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) under dopamine depletion.

I received my doctorate in Applied Mathematics through the Integrated Applied Mathematics Program at the Unviersity of New Hampshire under the supervision of Dr. Kevin Short. My doctoral work focused on mutual stabilization in chaotic neurons. Mutual stabilization can occur when two chaotic systems interact a certain way such that the individual systems are driven to periodic orbits due to nature of the interaction. Mutual stabilization was previously shown through interacting cupolets (chaotic unstable periodic orbit-lets) formed from two double scroll oscillators. The first major result of my dissertation demonstrated that two FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons, interacting bidirectionally, can exhibit chaotic behavior. This chaotic behavior can be controlled and shown to mutually stabilize when a sigmoidal synaptic learning rule is implemented. The second major result focused on showing the existence of cupolets in a chaotic Hindmarsh-Rose neuron. The properties of these cupolets were then explored and it was demonstrated how mutual stabilization can be achieved through two interacting Hindmarsh-Rose neurons. You can explore more of my doctoral work through the publications in 2020 and 2021 on the [Publications](https://jparker25.github.io/publications/) page.
