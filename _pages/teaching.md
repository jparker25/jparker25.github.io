# Teaching
At the University of Pittsburgh, I taught in my first three semesters. While at the University of New Hampshire, I was a teaching assistant every semester in the physics department and assisted with a variety of courses. Class descriptions from the university catalog are listed below. Feel free to reach out about any questions!

University of Pittsburgh (2021-2022, Fall 2023)


<details><summary><span style="font-size:0.75em;">MATH 0290: Differential Equations</span></summary>
<span style="font-size:0.75em;">
This course presents an introduction to the theory of differential equations from an applied perspective. Topics include linear and nonlinear ordinary differential equations, Laplace transform, and introduction to partial differential equations.</span>
</details>

<details><summary><span style="font-size:0.75em;">MATH 0220: Analytic Geometry and Calculus I</span></summary>
<span style="font-size:0.75em;">
This is the first of a sequence of three basic calculus courses. It covers the derivative and integral of functions of one variable and their applications.
</span>
</details>

<details><summary><span style="font-size:0.75em;">MATH 0125: Calculus for Business I</span></summary>
<span style="font-size:0.75em;">
This is the first half of a two course sequence (0125-0126). It will cover concepts such as limits, continuity, differentiation and integration. Maximization and minimization of functions will also be covered, with emphasis placed on applications in the social sciences, especially business and economics.

University of New Hampshire (2016-2021)


<details><summary><span style="font-size:0.75em;">PHYS 408H: Honors/General Physics II</span></summary>
<span style="font-size:0.75em;">
Introductory course emphasizing waves, sound, heat, electricity and magnetism. Recommended for students specializing in science and engineering. The honors version covers the same material as the traditional lecture course, but with three two-hour classes per week, most of which is spent working on activities in groups (rather than lecture). Students in the Honors section must be co-enrolled in MATH 426H so that strong connections can be made between math and physics. 408H students work in groups in every class meeting. Students in this version do not register for a recitation or lab, since these activities are integrated into the regular class meetings. Lab.
</span>
</details>


<details><summary><span style="font-size:0.75em;">PHYS 407S: General Physics I Studio</span></summary>
<span style="font-size:0.75em;">
Introductory course emphasizing motion, forces, energy, momentum, rotation, and oscillations. Recommended for the student specializing in science and engineering. The Studio version covers the same material as the traditional lecture course, but with three two-hour classes per week, most of which is spent working on activities in groups (rather than lecture). Students in this version do not register for a recitation or lab since these activities are integrated into the regular class meetings. Prereq: thorough knowledge of algebra, geometry, and trigonometry. Lab.
</span>

<details><summary><span style="font-size:0.75em;">PHYS 407: General Physics I</span></summary>
<span style="font-size:0.75em;">
Introductory course emphasizing motion, forces, energy, momentum, rotation, and oscillations. Recommended for the student specializing in science and engineering. This version is the traditional format with three lectures, one recitation (problem solving section), and one lab each week. Students in this version must also register for a particular recitation and lab. Prereq: thorough knowledge of algebra, geometry, and trigonometry. Lab.
</span>
</details>

<details><summary><span style="font-size:0.75em;">PHYS 402: Introduction to Physics II</span></summary>
<span style="font-size:0.75em;">
Broad survey of classical and modern physics. Designed to enable students to appreciate the role of physics in today's society and technology. Emphasizes the fundamental laws of nature on which all science is based, with some examples of interest to biologists. Knowledge of high school algebra, geometry, and trigonometry essential. Lab.
