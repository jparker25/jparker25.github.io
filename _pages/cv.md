Workshops
======
* NIH-BRAIN Summer 2017 Course: Models and Neurobiology, University of Missouri, Missouri, U.S.A., June 2017
  * Applied and accepted into a two-week, fully-funded, intensive National Institue of Health BRAIN course on interdisciplinary neural computational science. The course discussed mathematical and biological foundations of modern neuroscience. The program NEURON, based in Python, was used in building computer models of single and multi-cell neural firing.  

Research Projects
======
* Summer Internship Program, NIEHS, Summer 2013
  * Created MATLAB designed place fields at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) through analyzing neural probes and tracking movement of rodents that showcased neural activity in the CA2 (Cornu Ammonis 2) after the rodents had traveled and become familiar with a testing environment.
* Agent Based Modeling Cell Death, Elon University, August 2012 - May 2013
  * Modeled a dual-agent based NetLogo program to reflect BCL-2 proteins interacting with receptors to mimic known biological interactions.  Exported results of interactions to Mathematica for further analysis.
* Verdet Constant of Novel Supperparamagnetic Fluid, Elon University, August 2012 - May 2013 
  * Built an apparatus for testing the Verdet constant using a polarized laser and magnetic field.  Verified accuracy of apparatus by comparing experimental Verdet constants to known constants of materials.  Discovered directly proportional relationship of fluid concentration and Verdet constant of novel superparamagnetic fluid. 
  
Work experience
