As a Postdoctoral Associate at the University of Pittsburgh, I was the instructor of record for one course each semester.

### MATH 0220: Analytic Geometry and Calculus 1 (Spring 2022, 4 credits)
This is the first of a sequence of three basic calculus courses. It covers the derivative and integral of functions of one variable and their applications.

### MATH 0125: Business for Calculus 1 (Fall 2021, 2 credits)
This is the first half of a two course sequence (0125-0126). It will cover concepts such as limits, continuity, differentiation and integration. Maximization and minimization of functions will also be covered, with emphasis placed on applications in the social sciences, especially business and economics.
