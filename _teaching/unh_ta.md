Teaching assistant from Fall 2016 - Spring 2021 in the Integrated Applied Mathematics program, specifically working with the Department of Physics at the University of New Hampshire. As a teaching assistant, my role was to run either recitations or labs relating to the course, grade homework assignments and final exams, as well as hold review sessions. Below are the courses and semesters where I was the teaching assistant followed by the official UNH description of the course.

### PHYS 401: Introduction to Physics I (Fall 2016, 2018, 2019)
Broad survey of classical and modern physics. Designed to enable students to appreciate the role of physics in today's society and technology. Emphasizes the fundamental laws of nature on which all science is based, with some examples of interest to biologists. Knowledge of high school algebra, geometry, and trigonometry essential. 

### PHYS 402: Introduction to Physics II (Spring 2017, 2018, 2019)
Broad survey of classical and modern physics. Designed to enable students to appreciate the role of physics in today's society and technology. Emphasizes the fundamental laws of nature on which all science is based, with some examples of interest to biologists. Knowledge of high school algebra, geometry, and trigonometry essential. Prereq: PHYS 401

### PHYS 407: General Physics I (Fall 2017)
Introductory course emphasizing motion, forces, energy, momentum, rotation, and oscillations. Recommended for the student specializing in science and engineering. This version is the traditional format with three lectures, one recitation (problem solving section), and one lab each week. Students in this version must also register for a particular recitation and lab. Prereq: thorough knowledge of algebra, geometry, and trigonometry.

### PHYS 407S: General Physics I Studio (Spring 2021)
Introductory course emphasizing motion, forces, energy, momentum, rotation, and oscillations. Recommended for the student specializing in science and engineering. The Studio version covers the same material as the traditional lecture course, but with three two-hour classes per week, most of which is spent working on activities in groups (rather than lecture). Students in this version do not register for a recitation or lab since these activities are integrated into the regular class meetings. Prereq: thorough knowledge of algebra, geometry, and trigonometry.


### PHYS 408/408H: General Physics II  (Spring 2019 (Honors), Fall 2020)
Introductory course emphasizing waves, sound, heat, electricity and magnetism. Recommended for students specializing in science and engineering. This version is the traditional format with three lectures, one recitation (problem solving section), and one lab each week. Students in this version must also register for a particular recitation and lab. Prereq: PHYS 407
