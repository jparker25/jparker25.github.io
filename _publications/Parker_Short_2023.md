abstract: 'Recent work has highlighted the vast array of dynamics possible within both neuronal networks and individual neural models. In this work, we demonstrate the capability of interacting chaotic Hindmarsh–Rose neurons to communicate and transition into periodic dynamics through specific interactions which we call mutual stabilization, despite individual units existing in chaotic parameter regimes. Mutual stabilization has been seen before in other chaotic systems but has yet to be reported in interacting neural models. The process of chaotic stabilization is similar to related previous work, where a control scheme which provides small perturbations on carefully chosen Poincaré surfaces that act as control planes stabilized a chaotic trajectory onto a cupolet. For mutual stabilization to occur, the symbolic dynamics of a cupolet are passed through an interaction function such that the output acts as a control on a second chaotic system. If chosen correctly, the second system stabilizes onto another cupolet. This process can send feedback to the first system, replacing the original control, so that in some cases the two systems are locked into persistent periodic behavior as long as the interaction continues. Here, we demonstrate how this process works in a two-cell network and then extend the results to four cells with potential generalizations to larger networks. We conclude that stabilization of different states may be linked to a type of information storage or memory.'
