Oral presentation in the minisymposium titled Waves: Theory and Applications to Biomedical Sciences. The presentation focused on three aspects of understanding the basal ganglia output nucleus, the SNr. The first was how delta oscillations are a key marker of dopamine depletion, and where the delta oscillations come from. The second was classifying SNr neural responses to GPe optogenetic stimulation and the third was combining the previous to and past experimental work into a dynamical model.
