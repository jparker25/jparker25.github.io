Oral presentation in the minisymposium titled Data Driven Neural Modeling that was chaired by Jonathan Rubin and myself. The presentation focused on a new classification scheme for neural responses to optogenetic stimulation. The classification scheme was discussed then results were shown pertaining to SNr neural responses to optogenetic stimulation of the GPe in mice.
